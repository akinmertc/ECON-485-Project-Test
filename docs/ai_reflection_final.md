Throughout this project, our team extensively used AI tools (ChatGPT, Perplexity AI, dbdiagram.io, GitHub Copilot) while maintaining critical human oversight. AI proved invaluable for generating initial schema drafts and SQL boilerplate, reducing development time by approximately 50%. However, 71% of AI-generated outputs required significant corrections, particularly in normalization logic and business rule implementation.

Key learnings emerged from "fail-forward" experiences: ChatGPT initially suggested keeping transitive dependencies (HotelName in Bookings), which we corrected through manual normalization review. Python data generation scripts created unrealistic visitor-booking distributions, requiring manual curation. Most critically, AI lacked domain expertise in tourism economics—understanding seasonal patterns, international visitor premiums, and regional GDP impacts required human economic analysis.

Our approach balanced efficiency with accuracy: AI accelerated drafting, human expertise ensured correctness. This experience demonstrated that AI is a powerful assistant, not a replacement, for database design and economic interpretation. Domain knowledge remains irreplaceable.
